# NAME

Honeydew::CheckGmail - Get and save new emails from Gmail

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/honeydew-sc/Honeydew-CheckGmail.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/honeydew-sc/Honeydew-CheckGmail)

# VERSION

version 0.01

# SYNOPSIS

    my $gmail = Honeydew::CheckGmail->new;
    my $message = $gmail->get_message(subject => 'Password Reset');
    my $local_file = $gmail->write_message(subject => 'Password Reset');

# DESCRIPTION

Honeydew::CheckGmail is a convenience wrapper that takes care of
finding the newest email and saving it to a file such that we can view
it locally. With no arguments, the constructor will look up
credentials for a Gmail account in the config attribute.

# ATTRIBUTES

## user

Specify the short part of the Gmail account login - for example, if
the email is `something@gmail.com`, we just want `something`.

## password

Specify the password for the gmail account

## config

Specify a config instance. If not provided, ["user"](#user) and ["password"](#password)
will be looked up in this hash like such:

    my $config = {
        gmail => { user => 'user', password => 'password' }
    };
    my $gmail = Honeydew::CheckGmail->new(config => $config);

That would do the same thing as

    my $gmail = Honeydew::CheckGmail->new(
        user => 'user',
        password => 'password'
    );

## emaildir

Specify what directory ["save\_email"](#save_email) should write files to. Do not
provide the trailing slash.

## msg\_delay

Specify how recently an email must have arrived to be considered
new. Defaults to `120` seconds - that is, if an email's internal date
is less than two minutes old, we'll accept it as the new message that
you are waiting for.

    my $gmail = Honeydew::CheckGmail->new(
        msg_delay => 300 # a five minute old message is fine
    );

# METHODS

## get\_email(%search)

Search for the most recent email with a hash of search criteria. For
example, to search for an email with subject `foo` from `sender`,
you could do

    $gmail->get_email(subject => 'foo', from => 'sender');

We'll return a hashref with the message id and the body of the email:

    {
        id => $message_id,
        body => $html_rfc822_body
    }

If no messages are found, this will croak.

## save\_email($message)

Write the body of an email to a local directory for subsequent viewing
in a browser. Get your email message either with ["get\_email"](#get_email) or
["get\_new\_email"](#get_new_email), and then pass the result of either of those
function calls to this method. As argument, we expect a hashref with
key `body`, which we will write to a file.

    my $message = { body => 'some html' };
    my $file = $gmail->save_email($message);
    `cat $file`; # "some html"
